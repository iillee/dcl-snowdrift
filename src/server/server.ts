/**
 * server.ts — Squareoff authoritative server entry point.
 *
 * Thin orchestrator, flagtag-pattern. Runs in the headless SDK server
 * process (hammurabi-server). No 3D, no ~system/RestrictedActions —
 * pure state + WS message handling.
 *
 * Responsibilities: roster/team assignment, authoritative paint state
 * (CRDT chunks + palette), coverage CRDT publish, and UTC-boundary
 * roundReset. Paint *state* syncs via CRDT; paintTick remains the
 * client→server command channel.
