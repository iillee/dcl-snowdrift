/**
 * audio.ts — background music + UI click sound.
 *
 * Music is parented to the camera so it stays at ear-level anywhere in
 * the 160m scene. Starts muted so the scene loads quietly; the HUD mute
 * pill toggles it via toggleMusic().
 *
 * Playback position is tracked across pause/resume so the loop continues
 * where it left off instead of restarting each unmute. Pattern borrowed
 * from flagtag's boomboxState: the SDK reads currentTime on the
 * playing:false → true transition, so we must seek BEFORE flipping playing.
 *
 * Future SFX (paint hits, round-end fanfare) will register subscribers on
 * `eventBus` / `ClientEvents` from this module — keeping all audio config in one place.
