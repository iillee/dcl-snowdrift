/**
 * client.ts — client runtime orchestrator.
 *
 * Wires the client-side modules together in a controlled boot order and
 * registers the two top-level systems (seed watcher, first-joiner init)
 * that don't belong to any single feature module.
 *
 * All heavy lifting lives in its natural home:
 *   - client/maze/*                  — maze data, generation, visuals
 *   - client/paint                   — grid painting + coverage
 *   - client/clientHandler           — network boundary (room.on/send)
 *   - client/audio                   — music + UI SFX
 *   - client/ui/*                    — HUD layers + theme (React-ECS)
 *
 * Kept in this file (for now):
 *   - Composite lever-entity scrubber (removes a decorative composite entity)
 *   - Seed watcher (SeedHolder → rebuildMaze)
 *   - First-joiner init (roll seed if none is synced after grace period)
 *
 * These will move to client/index.ts in a future commit alongside a
 * proper waitForLoad gate (sky-chaser pattern).
