/**
 * messages.ts — shared WS message schema for Squareoff auth server.
 *
 * Registered from both client and server (identical schema). Follows the
 * flagtag pattern of a single `room` handle returned by registerMessages().
 *
 * Message set: joinRoster/teamAssigned, paintTick (command only),
 * roundReset, updateName, requestLeaderboard.
 *
 * Paint *state* (cell indexes + palette + coverage) syncs exclusively via
 * CRDT components — not paintDelta/snapshot room messages.
 *
 * SATURATION DISCIPLINE (write ONCE, enforce forever):
 *   - Client paintTick: PAINT_TICK_HZ (settings) — well under per-peer inbound cap
 *   - Paint state: one sparse PaintCell CRDT component per painted cell
 * See assets/docs/PHASE_4_PLAN.md for historical WS-delta reasoning; paint
 * state has since moved to granular CRDT components.

	// index into a per-cell PaintCell CRDT component. Not a state-sync channel.
	// WHY ids and not positions: server doesn't have the maze generator (it's
	// client-only for now), so it can't resolve position -> cell. Client
	// authors ids via worldToCellId locally; server trusts them for Phase 4.
	// Anti-cheat (position validation) is deferred to Phase 5 per the plan.
	// Rate limit: server caps ids per message from PAINT_BRUSH_SIZE_CELLS
	// (+ headroom); anything larger is dropped as suspicious.

	// tie") plus the seed for the new round. Server has already cleared its
	// paint CRDT chunks before/with this message.
